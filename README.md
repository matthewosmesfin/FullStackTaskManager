# Full Stack Task Manager
## Objective
To develop a basic full-stack application using Flutter for the front end and Django for the
backend. The project will involve user authentication and authorization using Keycloak,
communication between two Django microservices via RabbitMQ, data storage in PostgreSQL,
dynamic forms in Flutter, and integration testing using Patrol.

Currently a work in progress...
